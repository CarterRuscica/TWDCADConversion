# TWDCADConversion
Introduction on Android Studio project
This is my first Android-Studio project made to develop some familiarity with the program.
Was made to aid me on my travels to taiwan with realtime currency data without using google (with ability to work offline).


Version 1.01
- Working Currency Conversion for certain currencies
- Saving last used rate - will be updated to be more thorough

Version 1.20
- Flags for each supported currency
- Saving downloaded data to be used later on
- Made list of supported currencies for user to choose from
- Swap button to easily allow to and from currencies
- Clear to allow a new currency to be input
- Uses 2 save files, 1 for saving the last currencies converted, and another for the rate list.


This is not for commerical purposes, it is used for personal and learning experiences solely thanks to Bank of Canada for making the rates available.
